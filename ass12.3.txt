1.uses of nosql databases:

the nosql database when compared to the relational database possess supirior performance and are highly scalable.
it can perform analysis on several data issues which can not be resolve by the relational databases.such as bulk structured,semistructured and unstructured data,

it supports agile sprints, quick schema iteration, and frequent code pushes
Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible
Geographically distributed scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture
the following are the some of the NoSQL databases available:
*mongoDB
*Accumulo
*Cassandra
*Druid
*HBase
*Vertica
*SAP HANA

2. Differences between Hive and HBase :

*hive supports row formatted  analysis.
*hbase supports column formatted analysis.
*Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. It allows for querying data stored on HDFS for analysis via HQL, an SQL-like language that gets translated to MapReduce jobs. 
Despite providing SQL functionality, Hive does not provide interactive querying yet - it only runs batch processes on Hadoop.
*Apache HBase is a NoSQL key/value store which runs on top of HDFS. Unlike Hive, HBase operations run in real-time on its database rather than MapReduce jobs.

 HBase is partitioned to tables, and tables are further split into column families. Column families, which must be declared in the schema, group together a certain set of columns (columns don’t require schema definition).
 For example, the "message" column family may include the columns: "to", "from", "date", "subject", and "body". Each key/value pair in HBase is defined as a cell, and each key consists of row-key, column family, column, and time-stamp. A row in HBase is a grouping of key/value mappings identified by the row-key. HBase enjoys Hadoop’s infrastructure and scales horizontally using off the shelf servers.
